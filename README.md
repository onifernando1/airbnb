AirBnB clone:

Having followed the odin project curriculum, this is my react project.

I will utilise the following skills:

Javascript
React
HTML
CSS
Git

Aim:

To create a functional frontend website that is based on the airbnb website. I only want to use standard CSS - no boostrap! I am hoping to improve my react and javascript skills, use git, and work on my design skills.

Things I had to learn whilst making this application:
Routing in react, dynamic routes
Organizing a react project using components, assets and pages folders
